Brief

Game Store
The owner of a Game Store wants an app which will help to keep on top of the store inventory. This is not an app that customers will see, but will be used to check stock levels and see what needs to be ordered soon.

You should be able to add stock, which would have a Publisher and Game as well as the quantity available.


MVP:
Create games with the quantity that are in stock
Create publishers
Show an inventory page listing games and publishers
Show a stock level for the inventory items e.g. High/Medium/Low
